# ALS-Interpreter
Creating an AI/ML model integrated to a mobile application

This repo contains all the .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook) and the process of training the model. Starting from cleaning and processing the image dataset, initial training of the model, error analysis, and finally hyperparameter tuning the model

The saved models are also stored here alongside the converted .pb model which is the compatible format for the Flutter mobile application that we will be creating in another repository
